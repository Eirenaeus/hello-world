# hello-world
This is just a bit about me. I first learned rudimentary programming in High School - Basic and Fortran. In college I went on to program in Pascal, more Fortran, and some Cobol. I thought seriously of an EE degree, but was sidetracked into other explorations. I went on to work in design and planning, project management, and GIS analysis. Along the way, I used LISP programming in AutoCAD, VisualBasic, Delphi, and several other programming languages, and scripting in ArchInfo, Oracle, and dBase using SQL. There were forays into HTML, Java, and JS, to name a few. Despite all this, nothing panned out professionally. Now I am considering again a leap into programming again, through CodeCamp.
